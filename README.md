## data_structure_start

This project contains several implementations of classic data structures and algorithms, like

- Sorting algorithms (e.g. three-way quick, merge sort, etc)
- Disjoint Set Union (DSU)
- KMP
- Other classic algorithms

They all are written in C++, and each can be complied and executed as standalone file.

Most importantly, I think they are my best templates I can write for practice and reuse. 

### python version

I am also learning python, so I rewrote them to python version:

Please enjoy the world of algorithm!
